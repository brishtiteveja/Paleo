Lumping the original Cordevolian and Julian into a new extended Julian substage (e. g. KRYSTYN 1974) violates the priority without convincing faunistic reason. Very characteristic for the Cordevolian is the co-occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian elements in all fossil groups, whereas the Ladinian elements disappear around the base of the Julian. The high percentage of Ladinian elements, in addition to the first occurrence of many Carnian forms, is the reason why the Cordevolian was for a long time considered to represent the youngest substage of the Ladinian.  The Julian begins with the Trachyceras aonoides Zone, which is characterised by both the disappearance of the last Ladinian holdovers and by the appearance of numerous new Carnian or Carnian-Norian types in all stratigraphically important fossil groups, especially well recognisable in radiolarian faunas.

Lumping the original Cordevolian and Julian into a new extended Julian substage (e. g. KRYSTYN 1974) violates the priority without convincing faunistic reason. Very characteristic for the Cordevolian is the co-occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian elements in all fossil groups, whereas the Ladinian elements disappear around the base of the Julian. The high percentage of Ladinian elements, in addition to the first occurrence of many Carnian forms, is the reason why the Cordevolian was for a long time considered to represent the youngest substage of the Ladinian.  The Julian begins with the Trachyceras aonoides Zone, which is characterised by both the disappearance of the last Ladinian holdovers and by the appearance of numerous new Carnian or Carnian-Norian types in all stratigraphically important fossil groups, especially well recognisable in radiolarian faunas.
